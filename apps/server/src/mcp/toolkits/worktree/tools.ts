  description:
    "Needs an agent running inside a T3 thread. Move this agent thread into a git worktree. To launch a separate agent already bound to a new or existing worktree, use t3_thread_launch with workspaceStrategy instead. By default, creates the worktree branch (optionally from origin), re-points the thread at the worktree, and runs the project's setup script there. To move into a worktree that already exists (for example one a project script just created), pass attach:true with its absolute path; it must be one of the project's git worktrees (see t3_worktree_list), branch is optional and must match the checked-out branch, the setup script does not run unless runSetupScript is true, and T3 never removes that worktree or its branch, even if the handoff fails. Changing the workspace detaches the live provider session, so the current turn ends shortly after the handoff is recorded; call this as the last action of the turn. To keep working after the handoff, pass continuationPrompt with the remaining work: it is queued as the thread's next message and starts a new turn inside the worktree with the conversation preserved. Without it the thread stays idle until the next message. The worktree is not removed automatically when the thread is deleted. Fails if the thread is already attached to a worktree: a thread cannot move between worktrees or back to the project root.",
